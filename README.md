 Spotify Clone – HTML & CSS Project

This project is a front-end clone of Spotify, built using HTML5 and CSS3 to replicate the look and feel of the popular music streaming platform. The design mimics the homepage layout, navigation sidebar, music player controls, and responsive layout of the original Spotify interface.

It’s a static website, focused entirely on UI/UX design, with no backend or music streaming functionality.

✨ Features:
🎨 Clean and modern UI inspired by Spotify

📱 Fully responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile

📂 Sidebar with navigation links (Home, Search, Library)

🎧 Bottom music player bar with play/pause, skip, and volume icons

📸 Playlist cards with album cover, title, and hover effects

🌓 Dark theme to match Spotify’s aesthetic

🛠️ Technologies Used:
HTML5 for semantic structure

CSS3 for styling and layout (Flexbox & Grid used)

Google Fonts and Font Awesome for icons and typography

Media queries for responsiveness

📌 How to Use:
Clone or download the repository.

Open index.html in your browser.

Explore the layout and enjoy the Spotify-inspired interface.

🚀 Future Improvements (Optional):
Add JavaScript for interactive controls (play/pause, song switching).

Connect to an API for streaming real music.

Build a backend with user login and playlist saving.
